    "# Q1. Lasso Regression is a linear regression method that adds a penalty term to the sum of squared residuals of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. \n",
    "# The penalty term is the absolute value of the coefficients multiplied by a tuning parameter (lambda), which shrinks the coefficients towards zero and performs variable \n",
    "# selection by setting some of the coefficients to zero. This makes Lasso Regression useful for high-dimensional datasets with many features, as it can effectively reduce \n",
    "# the number of features used in the model. Lasso Regression differs from other regression techniques like Ridge Regression and OLS in the way it shrinks the coefficients \n",
    "# and performs variable selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is that it can effectively identify and exclude irrelevant or redundant features from the model by setting their \n",
    "# corresponding coefficients to zero. This reduces the complexity of the model and improves its interpretability, as well as its generalization performance by reducing overfitting. \n",
    "# Lasso Regression can also handle correlated features better than other feature selection methods, such as stepwise regression, which can suffer from unstable and biased estimates \n",
    "# in the presence of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. The coefficients of a Lasso Regression model represent the effect of each feature on the target variable, after accounting for the effect of the other features and the \n",
    "# regularization penalty. Positive coefficients indicate a positive correlation between the feature and the target, while negative coefficients indicate a negative correlation. \n",
    "# The magnitude of the coefficients reflects the strength of the correlation, with larger magnitudes indicating stronger effects. Coefficients that are set to zero indicate that \n",
    "# the corresponding features have been excluded from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. The tuning parameter lambda is the main parameter that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and it controls the strength of the regularization penalty. Larger values of \n",
    "# lambda lead to stronger shrinkage and more aggressive feature selection, while smaller values of lambda allow more flexibility and larger coefficients. Another parameter that\n",
    "# can be adjusted is the intercept, which can be included or excluded in the model. The choice of these parameters can affect the model's performance in terms of bias, variance,\n",
    "# and prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Yes, Lasso Regression can be used for non-linear regression problems by applying non-linear transformations to the input features, such as polynomial expansion or\n",
    "# interaction terms. These transformations can capture non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable, and can be combined with Lasso Regression to\n",
    "# perform variable selection and regularization. Another approach for non-linear regression is to use kernel methods, such as kernel regression or support vector regression,\n",
    "# which can implicitly map the input features into a higher-dimensional space and apply Lasso Regression in that space.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. The main difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression is the type of regularization penalty used. Ridge Regression adds a penalty term that is proportional \n",
    "# to the square of the coefficients, while Lasso Regression adds a penalty term that is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. This leads to different shrinkage \n",
    "# patterns and variable selection behavior, as Ridge Regression tends to shrink all the coefficients towards zero proportionally, while Lasso Regression can set some of the coefficients\n",
    "# exactly to zero, effectively performing variable selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7. Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features by performing variable selection and excluding redundant features that are highly correlated with other \n",
    "# features. This can improve the stability and interpretability of the model, as well as its generalization performance by reducing overfitting. However, Lasso Regression may still \n",
    "# suffer from bias and instability if the multicollinearity is severe, as it can lead to unstable and unreliable estimates of the coefficients and the tuning parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q8. The optimal value of the regularization parameter lambda in Lasso Regression can be chosen using cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation or leave-one-out\n",
